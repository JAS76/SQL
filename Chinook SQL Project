To find out more about the data I'm querying information from a dataset called chinook.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM customers 
WHERE Country != "USA";

#2. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM invoices AS inv 
LEFT JOIN customers AS cust 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

#3. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM Invoices;

#4. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM employees emp 
JOIN Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#5. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#6. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT ar.name AS Artist, t.Name AS Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;

#7. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales' 
FROM Employees emp
JOIN Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;
